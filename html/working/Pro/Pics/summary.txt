Health Care:

Health Care is not a privilege. It's a right. It's a right as fundamental as civil rights. It's a right as fundamental as giving every child a chance to get a public education.

"Every patient carries his or her own doctor inside" --Albert Schweitzer

Child Care:

Every time a woman leaves the workforce because she can't find or afford childcare, or she can't work out a flexible arrangement with her boss, or she has no paid maternity leave, her family's income falls down a notch. Simultaneously, national productivity numbers decline.

"Babies have much higher levels of stress in childcare." --Mem Fox

Army Support:

The true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him, but because he loves what is behind him.

"The army teaches boys to think like men." --Elvis Presley

Cancer Treatment:

Some kids wish to be a cowboy.....to be a princess.....to be a chef while others wish for a cure so they can grow up

"We have two options, medically and emotionally: give up or fight like hell." --Lance Armstrong

Refugees:

"What is at stake is nothing less than the survival and well-being of a generation of innocents" --Antonio Guterres

"To save a life, is to save all of humanity" --White Helmets

Disaster Relief:

We cannot stop natural disasters but we can arm ourselves with knowledge: so many lives wouldn't have to be lost if there was enough disaster preparedness.

"While natural disasters capture headlines and national attention short-term, the work of recovery and rebuilding is long-term." --Sylvia Mathews Burwell
